    "This notebook documents the test cases for the FlexAI chatbot to ensure it provides accurate and helpful responses. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the chatbot's strengths, weaknesses, and the specific areas where it fails, by analyzing its performance across various prompts. This analysis will help identify areas where the chatbot excels, areas that require improvement, and critical failure points that need to be addressed for better user experience and reliability."

      "To design a workout plan for building muscle while losing fat, you should focus on a combination of resistance training and a calorie-controlled diet.\n",
      "Here are some key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\n",
      "**Resistance Training**: Incorporate weightlifting exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press.\n",
      "This will help you build muscle mass.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "**Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase the weight or resistance you're lifting over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "**Aerobic Exercise**: Include some form of aerobic exercise, such as cardio, to help with fat loss.\n",
      "However, keep in mind that anaerobic exercises (like weightlifting) can also burn calories and contribute to fat loss.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "**Diet**: Focus on a calorie-controlled diet that provides enough protein to support muscle growth.\n",
      "Aim for a caloric deficit to promote fat loss, but not so low that it hinders muscle growth.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "**Specificity and Transfer Principle**: Train for strength and muscle volume by using considerable weight, and focus on diet for fat loss and muscle definition.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "**Consistency and Patience**: Building muscle and losing fat takes time and consistency.\n",
      "Make sure to stick to your workout plan and diet for an extended period to see results.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sample workout plan might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 3-4 days of weightlifting per week, focusing on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press\n",
      "* 1-2 days of cardio per week, such as jogging or cycling\n",
      "* A calorie-controlled diet with a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats\n",
      "* Progressive overload by increasing weight or resistance over time\n",
      "* Adequate rest and recovery time to allow muscles to grow and repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, everyone's body is different, and it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer to create a personalized workout plan that suits your needs and goals.\n"

      "If you have knee pain, there are several adjustments you can make to your workouts to help alleviate the discomfort and prevent further injury.\n",

      "Secondly, incorporate exercises that strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles.\n",
      "Strengthening these muscles can help provide additional support and stability to the knee joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, consider modifying your exercises to reduce the stress on your knees.\n",

      "Additionally, pay attention to your form and technique when performing exercises.\n",
