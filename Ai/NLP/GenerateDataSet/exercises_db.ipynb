      "Deadlifts are to strength training what running is to cardio. The benefits of weightlifting are infinite, and deadlifts are an excellent strength training exercise to add into your weight lifting roster. Deadlifts are one of the best full body exercises you can perform to build muscle and burn fat. Understanding how to deadlift properly will make a massive difference between a fantastic strength training session and one where you end up with a sore back.

      "Three Key Fundamentals to Proper Deadlift Technique\n",
      "Proper technique is vital when doing a deadlift. You need to remember three essential deadlift techniques when performing a deadlift.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Always keep your weight close to your body, this will make your lift more efficient and improve your strength.  \n",

      "Lastly, never squat when doing a deadlift. Squatting while deadlifting puts unnecessary stress on your lower back. \n",

      "Benefits of Deadlifting\n",
      " \n",
      "Deadlifts are known in fitness as a great way to build strength. However, there are a wide variety of ways this exercise can upgrade your body and overall health. When you learn how to deadlift properly, the benefits you’ll get from this move are endless. Below are a few benefits of the deadlift. \n",
      "\n",
      "Deadlifts increase and activate your core strength. You depend on your core’s stability to lift the weight off the ground and help keep your balance when doing a deadlift.  \n",
      "Your body will gain more mobility from deadlifting because your joints are being moved and pushed through a full range of motion during this exercise. \n",
      "You can enhance your cardiovascular endurance when deadlifting by increasing the number of reps you do.  \n",
      "Deadlifts are a fantastic way to increase your glute gains and strengthen your hamstrings. The Journal of Strength and Conditioning states that when compared to back squats the deadlift is a more effective exercise for targeting the hip extensor muscles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why Proper Deadlifting Form is Key\n",
      " \n",
      "Remember, proper deadlift technique is crucial to avoid injury, discomfort, and to see results. Deadlifting is a great strength training exercise to build strength, elevate your athletic performance, and work out your entire body. Whether you deadlift with dumbbells, a barbell, or a kettlebell, make sure you are deadlifting with a weight that suits you and enhances the burn.\n",
      "\"Deadlifting makes you feel powerful,\" said Moss. \"It's one of the few lifts that you can go heavy on. Feeling that accomplishment is amazing.” So, get ready, get serious and lift! Stay focused and consistent as you increase how much you deadlift. Each week, up your weight amount, and eventually you’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come.\n",
