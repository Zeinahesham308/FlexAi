    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook documents the test cases for the FlexAI chatbot to ensure it provides accurate and helpful responses. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the chatbot's strengths, weaknesses, and the specific areas where it fails, by analyzing its performance across various prompts. This analysis will help identify areas where the chatbot excels, areas that require improvement, and critical failure points that need to be addressed for better user experience and reliability."
